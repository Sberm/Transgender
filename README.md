# Transgender

![](img/trans.png)

A TUI file explorer with zero dependancy except for libc, written by a ranger hater.

## quick start

compile
```
make
```

and then enjoy
```bash
trans
```

keys:

|keys|function|
|:---:|:---:|
|o|go to directory under cursor|
|\<ENTER\>|go to directory under cursor|
|s|go to current directory(in left side window)|
|q|quit|


```
WHY DO I MAKE TRANS?

In my opinion trans is simpler than ranger. Creeping
featurism, growing size made ranger less attractive. 
Also, ranger is not a good software, it is filled
with bad designs that irritate its users.
